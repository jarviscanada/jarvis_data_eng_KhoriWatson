      "description": "This app was designed as a way to let users quickly and easily flag broken or damaged infrastructure in their community to 311 in Toronto. It made use of geolocation data to simplify the process of communicating where maintenance crews needed to go to fix each issue. This application was built using React Native and Next.js and a more of a proof of concept and was not actually connected to the 311 API for the city of Toronto, but it did access hardware GPS iniformation to provide accurate geolocation data.",

      "description": "This project simulates a monitoring agent that gathers data about Linux machines linked together in a cluster. It centers on 3 separate bash scripts which collectively create and control the running of a Docker container made from a lightweight Postgres Docker image and parse hardware and resource usage information via a series of commands and construct SQL statements to insert into a shared database store on a Docker volume. The script is automated via a crontab job to continuously update the database with real-time usage data.",

It involved querying a simulated PostgreSQL database of order data to extract customer and order information as well as using transactions to ensure atomicity.",
        "Grep App: This project is a recreation of the 'grep' terminal command done in Java. It searches through all the files in a directory recursively and extracts any lines that match a user-provided regular expression and then save all those lines to a file. Two implementations of this project were written: one that leveraged pre-Java 8 features exclusively (standard Java Collecitons and File IO API) and another that introduce Java 8 features, including Java NIO, Paths, Streams, and Lambdas. The latter implementation was done to showcase how these new features (streams especially) allow us to bypass some of the limitations caused by heap sizes in the JVM."
